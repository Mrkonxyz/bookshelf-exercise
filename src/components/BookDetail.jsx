                        Even bad code can function. But if code isn‚Äôt clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way.
                        Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioner‚Äôs point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmer‚Äïbut only if you work at it.
